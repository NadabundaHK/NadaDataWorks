Customer Churn Prediction
This repository focuses on predicting customer churn using the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset. The goal is to analyze the data, preprocess it, and build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave or stay with the company.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains customer information from a bank, including demographic details, account information, and transactional history. Key features include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
CreditScore: Customer’s credit score.
Surname 
Geography: Customer’s location (e.g., France, Germany, Spain).
Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
Age: Customer's age.
Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
Balance: Account balance.
NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer uses.
HasCrCrad
IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member.
EstimatedSalary
Exited: Target variable (1 if the customer churned, 0 otherwise).

Project Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identifying patterns, correlations, and key insights.
Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (if Any)
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender).
Scaling numerical features for model compatibility.

Model Training:

Training machine learning models like  ANN.
Predicting Test Data.
Converting probabilities to binary.
Model evaluation.
