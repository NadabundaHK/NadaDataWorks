# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository focuses on predicting **customer churn** using the `Churn_Modelling.csv` dataset. The goal is to analyze the data, preprocess it, and build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave or stay with the company.

### Key Features:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **CreditScore**: Customer's credit score.
- **Surname**: Customer's surname.
- **Geography**: Customer's location (e.g., France, Germany, Spain).
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: Account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1: Yes, 0: No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer's estimated salary.
- **Exited**: Target variable (1: Customer churned, 0: Customer stayed).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzing data distribution, identifying patterns, and understanding correlations between features.
- Creating visualizations to summarize findings.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (if any).
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender).
- Feature scaling to ensure numerical features are normalized.

### 3. Model Training
- Building machine learning models such as:
  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  - Predicting test data
  - Converting Probabilities to binary
  - Model Evaluation
